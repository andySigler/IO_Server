#PatchBay

##A Platform of Making Connections

[The old version from my 2014 Master Thesis can be viewed here.](https://github.com/andysigler/patchbay-thesis-2014)

This repo contains the hardware designs, Arduino library, and interface software to run Patchbay. It is in active development and will be updating often. The Arduino library is currently working on the ATmega328 (Arduino Uno), and the interface is currently run using NodeJS and HTML5 for development before moving to mobile.
