#PatchBay

##Tools for Designing the Internet of Useless Things

PatchBay is the outcome of my thesis at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP), during the Spring 2014 Semester. It is comprised of a Node.js server, accompanying HTML5 graphical interface, Arduino library for connecting devices, and Eagle designs for my board (based of the JeeNode).

For a more comprehensive description of the project and how the system works, please visit http://www.andysigler.com/patchbay.

###NodeJS Server Installation

Download the repo, and cd into the folder "node", which contains the script and client-side code.

Install the required node-modules using:

```
npm install
```

Start the server with:

```
node app.js
```
