#PatchBay

##A Platform of Making Connections

A repo has been made to store the 2014 version for my masters thesis [here](https://github.com/andysigler/patchbay-thesis-2014), and my thesis presentation can be seen [here](http://andysigler.com/projects/how-to-make-the-internet-of-useless-things/).

This repo contains the hardware designs, Arduino library, and interface software to run Patchbay. It is in active development and will be updating often. The Arduino library is currently working on the ATmega328 (Arduino Uno), and the interface is currently run using NodeJS and HTML5 for development before moving to mobile.
