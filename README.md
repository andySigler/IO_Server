#PatchBay

##Tools for Designing the Internet of Useless Things

PatchBay is the outcome of my thesis at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP), during the Spring 2014 Semester. It is comprised of a Node.js server, accompanying HTML5 graphical interface, Arduino library for connecting devices, and eagle designs for my board (based of the JeeNode).

For a more comprehensive description of the project and how the system works, please visit andysigler.com/patchbay.
